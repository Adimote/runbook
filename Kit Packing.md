# Kit Packing

The purpose Kit Packing is to take the tested parts from the [[Kit Collation]] Event and pack them into kits ready for use by teams. There is roughly a month between the two events to allow for repairs to be made and replacement parts purchased. At the end of Kit Packing the kits are loaded onto a pallet and shipped to our post handling provider. The kits will later be forwarded to the various Kickstart locations once the number of teams at each location has been confirmed.

## Process

Before kits can be packed, there is some preparation work that must be done. Each of these tasks can be performed in parallel.

  1. [WIRE](#markdown-header-wire) - The wire must be cut to length.
  1. [CAMCON](#markdown-header-camcon) - The camcon connectors must be counted out and bagged.
  1. [LAYOUT](#markdown-header-layout) - Boxes of each type of part must be laid out around the room.

Once the preparation tasks have been completed the packing can commence. The process is strictly sequential for each kit, but multiple kits may be flowing through the process simultaneously.

  1. [FILL](#markdown-header-fill) - Fill a kit box with the parts.
  1. [SCAN](#markdown-header-scan) - Scan and move all of the tracked parts into the box in the Inventory.
  1. [CHECK](#markdown-header-check) - Perform a check of the box contents and check off everything on a check list.
  1. [JIFFY](#markdown-header-jiffy) - Pack the box contents into Jiffy bags.
  1. [PACK](#markdown-header-pack) - Pack the Jiffy bags and remaining parts into the box with scrunched up paper.

[PALLET](#markdown-header-pallet) - Once all kits have been packed they can be loaded onto a pallet.

## WIRE

Each kit contains 3 lengths of thick (1mm²) wire and 4 lengths of thin (0.5mm²) wire. Since the wire is purchased on 100m reels it needs to be cut to length and folded/knotted ready for packing. The wire needs to be cut into the following:

 * 1.8m lengths of 1mm² wire (red, black and blue)
 * 3m lengths of 0.5mm² wire (red, black, blue and yellow)

After being cut the wires should be folded and knotted. A demonstration on how to do this will be given at the event.

## CAMCON

Each kit contains various 'Camcon' pluggable terminal block connectors. These must be counted/weighed out and bagged up. Fill resealable plastic bags with the following:

 * 10x 7.5mm camcons
 * 7x 5mm camcons
 * 1x 3.81mm camcon

## LAYOUT

To help with the filling of kits, boxes of each constituent part should be placed around the room such that one can easily walk around filling a kit box without missing an part. All parts should be laid out, including the wire and camcons. See the [canonical kit list](https://bitbucket.org/richardbarlow/sr-kit-coord/wiki/Kit_Definition) for reference.
