# Kit Packing

The purpose Kit Packing is to take the tested parts from the [[Kit Collation]] Event and pack them into kits ready for use by teams. There is roughly a month between the two events to allow for repairs to be made and replacement parts purchased. At the end of Kit Packing the kits are loaded onto a pallet and shipped to our post handling provider. The kits will later be forwarded to the various Kickstart locations once the number of teams at each location has been confirmed.
