Kit return staff are responsible for receiving kit from teams at the end of the
competition and checking it. A combination of door guards and teams having to
sign out at reception should ensure that kit return staff do not have to
actively solicit kit from teams: they should present it to the staff.

Kit should only be accepted when it is placed in a RUB: loose kit should be
rejected [0]. When presented with a RUB full of kit, kit return staff should:
 * Put the RUB on the kit return desk and instruct the team member to hang
   around while the contents are checked
 * Take a printed list-of-kit and examine the returned kit, ticking off items
   that are definitely in the RUB.
 * If any items are missing, ask the team member where they are; they should
   return them immediately if the kit items are on site, we do not allow partial
   kit return.
 * If items are missing and not on-site, write these onto a printed 'missing kit
   form', and have the team member sign it.
 * Release the team member to leave
 * Take the ticked-off list-of-kit form, sign it, and place it in the RUB
 * Tape the RUB handles up with electrical tape (to indicate it should be
   treated as sealed)
 * Put a name label on the *end* of the RUB and write the teams TLA on it
   (to allow for swift lookup of whos-rub-has-been-returned)
 * Place the RUB onto a stack of returned kit.

[0] With the exception of German teams, as they didn't get any RUBs in sr2016.
