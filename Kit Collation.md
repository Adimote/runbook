# Kit Collation

The purpose of Kit Collation is to gather together all kit parts from the previous Competition Programme year, test them and store them ready for packing at the [[Kit Packing]] Event.

## Tasks

1. CHECKIN - Unpack each kit and scan its contents into a new directory in the Inventory.
1. VISUAL - Visually inspect each part for damage.
1. CLEAN - Clean each part.
1. TEST - Test each part, where possible.
1. CHECKOUT - Pack parts of the same type into boxes and update the Inventory.

## CHECKIN

Remove each part from the kit box and move it into a new directory in the Inventory. There is no need to worry about keeping track of which team the part came from, as this information can be retrieved from the Inventory at a later date if required.
