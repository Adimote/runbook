# Kit Collation

The purpose of Kit Collation is to gather together all kit parts from the previous Competition Programme year, test them and store them ready for packing at the [[Kit Packing]] Event.

## Process

Each kit must go through the following process. Once the CHECKIN task has been performed for a given kit the remaining tasks can be run in parallel - especially the testing of different parts.

1. [CHECKIN](#markdown-header-checkin) - Unpack each kit and scan its contents into a new directory in the Inventory.
1. [VISUAL](#markdown-header-visual) - Visually inspect each part for damage.
1. [CLEAN](#markdown-header-clean) - Clean each part.
1. [TEST](#markdown-header-test) - Test each part, where possible.
1. [CHECKOUT](#markdown-header-checkout) - Pack parts of the same type into boxes and update the Inventory.

## CHECKIN

Remove each part from the kit box and move it into a directory containing all checked in kit in the Inventory. There is no need to worry about keeping track of which team the part came from, as this information can be retrieved from the Inventory at a later date if required. Mark each part as having `condition: unknown`.

If there are any parts remaining in the kit box in the Inventory after all parts have been removed make a note of their part codes. This will be followed up with the team if necessary.

## VISUAL

Inspect parts for visible functional damage - mild cosmetic damage is not a concern. See the following table for example of functional damage for each part and what to do if there is damage. For some parts the damage observed means that there is little point in continuing with testing and therefore it should just be marked as broken and put into the broken part box (and moved in the inventory). In other situations it may be that the damage can be repaired, so further testing should continue. In this case add the part code to the list of failed visual inspections, update the inventory with details of the failure and otherwise treat it as a pass (do not put it in the broken part box).
