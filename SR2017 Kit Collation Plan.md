# SR2017 Kit Collation Plan

The SR2017 Kit Collation Event follows the general plan outlined on the [[Kit Collation]] page. This page is to document any deviations from this plan or to document more details.

## CHECKIN

All parts, excluding RUBs, are to be scanned into the `kit-collation-venue/checked-in` directory in the Inventory.

Once all non-RUB parts have been moved each RUB should be checked to ensure it is empty and then moved into the `kit-collation-venue/checked-in` directory too. Any parts shown to be in the RUBs in the inventory should be moved into the `kit-collation-venue/missing` directory. `lipo-bag-overlander-22x30` parts should be checked to ensure that they're empty. Any batteries still shown to be in a bag should be moved into the `kit-collation-venue/missing` directory.

All `ruggeduino-case` assets should be deleted and their case asset stickers removed/covered. We are no longer tracking the cases as separate entities.

Once all parts have been moved their status is to be set to 'unknown'.
