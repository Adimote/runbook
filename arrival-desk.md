Brand new this year!

The arrival desk is a location for co-ordinating with teams and volunteers at
the start of the competition. There are two aims:
 * Team entry/exit recording
 * Stripping restricted parts of robots
 * Provisioning arriving volunteers with information

Arrival desk staff will have sign-in / sign-out sheet(s) for team leaders to
record that their teams have arrived and when they leave. Reception will direct
team leaders to the desk; you should get the team-leader to sign the sheet.

You should then inform the team-leader that we remove three SR-issued items from
teams on entry:
 * Batteries
 * Battery chargers
 * Battery charging bags
and that they *must* arrange for their team to deliver those items to the desk.

Competitors with kit will turn up (from reception, or from team leaders). You
should ask them whether they have any of the two items above on them, and if
they do, retain them. If they're embedded in a robot, get the competitor to
extract them. Retained items should be put in a RUB or on the desk; someone
from helpdesk will move them upstairs (XXX co-ordination).

Finally, volunteers will also be turning up, at the start of the day and
throughout the competition. They need to be provided with the t-shirt they
ordered and a printed schedule of what they're doing for the day.

After initial influx, the reception will absorb this role.
