Reception staff control entry to the building and validate people's competition
tickets and/or wristbands. Each reception staffer has a desk, chair, and
computer.

There are four flavours of visitor to the competition: competitors,
team-leaders, volunteers and true-visitors.

When someone enters the building, the following procedure should be
followed:
 * Call the guest forwards to their desk
 * Entrance to the competition is allowed according to the rules below: you
   should start by asking whether the guest is a competitor or not, and then
   determine what flavour of visitor they are from there.
   * If they are a COMPETITOR or TEAM-LEADER with a TICKET:
     * Scan the QR code on the ticket (with the reception-desk software [0]) and
       check them in
   * If they are a team-leader WITHOUT a ticket:
     * Have them fill in a media consent form
   * If they are a COMPETITOR and wish to fill in or return a MCF:
     * Call for jmorse, who will determine whether we should accept it
   * If they are a volunteer:
     * Have them fill in a media consent form
   * If they are a true-visitor:
     * Have them fill in a media consent form
     * Check whether they appear on a guest-list that you'll be issued with.
       If they are, then someone at the comeptition wants to know when they
       arrive: you should phone the number on the guest list when this occurs.
   * If none of these criteria are met, you should deny them entry to the
     competition.
 * If entry is granted, hand the guest a wristband and ask them to get it
   crimped.
 * Some guests should visit the arrival desk when they arrive. These are:
   * All volunteers
   * All team-leaders
   * Any competitors holding robots or kit boxes
 * Allow the person into the building

At the start of the competition day there will be four reception staffers
covering the entrance. Once the initial influx of people is complete, this
will reduce to two. Additionally, after the initial influx, receptionists
should allow people wearing SR wristbands to enter the building at will (they
should check that people walking in have one, or follow the procedure above).

Throughout the competition reception staffers will encounter a variety of
members of the public enquiring what the event is, or otherwise receiving
questions. Please answer as fully as possible, but refer any technical questions
to helpdesk, or other unknown matters to other people in SR. Any member
of the public should be allowed into the building if they sign a media consent
form.

After the initial influx of people, the 'crimper' and 'arrival-desk' roles
will be absorbed by the receptionist. If you have a time slot after the first
slot of the day, read those roles too.
