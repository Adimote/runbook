Reception staff control entry to the building and validate people's competition
tickets and/or wristbands. Each reception staffer has a desk, chair, and
computer. When someone enters the building, the following procedure should be
followed:
 * Call the guest forwards to their desk
 * Ask whether the visitor has a ticket, and:
   * If they DO:
     * Scan the QR code on the ticket (with the reception-desk software [0]) and
       check them in
     * Hand them a wristband
   * If they DO NOT (have a ticket)
     * If they are obviously an adult: 
       * Ask them to fill in a media consent form
       * Give them a wristband
   * In case of any failure, call for jmorse
 * Once the above is complete, tell them that team-leaders/teachers should
   report to the team-leader desk. Anyone obviously holding a robot or kit
   box should be told that, if they have a battery or battery charger in there,
   that they should report to the team-leader desk.
 * Allow the person into the building

At the start of the competition day there will be four reception staffers
covering the entrance. Once the initial influx of people is complete, this
will reduce to two. Additionally, after the initial influx, receptionists
should allow people wearing SR wristbands to enter the building at will (they
should check that people walking in have one, or follow the procedure above).

Throughout the competition reception staffers will encounter a variety of
members of the public enquiring what the event is, or otherwise receiving
questions. Please answer as fully as possible, but don't be afraid to refer
any technical questions or unknown matters to other people in SR. Any member
of the public should be allowed into the building if they sign a media consent
form.
