**Mentoring**


* Contact the Volunteer Coordinator asking for potential Mentors.
* A GoogleForm can be used to obtain the following information:
    * Confirm over 18
    * Name
    * Email address
    * Location
    * How far willing to travel to mentor
    * Roughly how often could commit to visiting a team
    * What skills do you possess making you suitable mentor
    * Previous SR experience

* Once replies obtained, make ‘Mentor Sign-Up’ spreadsheet with this info and share with LTCs so that they can review and match Mentors with their teams.

* LTCs should:
    * contact their team leaders to ask them about when, where and how often they meet to be able to match with a potential mentor (might want to produce a Google Form to streamline the information captured)
    * plot potential mentors on a map and plot the location of your teams
    * once received the details of the Team meeting times/locations etc. match up geographically close potential mentors to teams
    * enter the potential TLA by the mentor on the Mentor Sign-Up spreadsheet to identify any clashes.
    * contact potential Mentor to inform them of their matched team to confirm availability etc. with Team Leader contact info, HIGHLIGHT that mentor should only be interacting with the Team Leader as the responsible adult (i.e over 18) for the team.  DIRECT them to Page 27 of Ops Manual for further info re. being a Mentor.
    * contact Team Leader to inform them of mentor, giving Mentor contact info.
    * check up on progress of Mentoring relationship through email updates.
