# SR2017 Pit Documentation

[TOC]

## Pre-competition Preparation

There are 54 pits in SR2017 split over two floors of the venue, 22 on floor 0 and 32 on floor 2.

### Flags
To help locate teams, each pit has a 'flag' with the team's TLA on it. This flag consists of a 1.2m bamboo cane taped to the table with an A4 piece of card taped at the top. A piece of paper with the team's TLA is stuck on each side of the card.

### Table and Chair Requirements
Each pit requires a single 2x6ft or 2x8ft 'large' trestle table and 6 chairs. This is 54 tables and 324 chairs.

### Tape Order
48mm wide masking tape is used to mark out the pit boundaries. 462m of tape is required for all of the pit boundaries. The tape comes in 50m rolls, so order 12 rolls (to have some spare). http://www.gaffatape.com/Paper-Masking-Tape/default.aspx
