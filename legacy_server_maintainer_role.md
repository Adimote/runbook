# Legacy Server Maintainer (LSM) Role Definition

This page defines the Legacy Server Maintainer (LSM) role that reports to the Kit Software Coordinator. This role cannot create subordinate roles.

## Purpose
The role of the LSM is to maintain the operation of the legacy server inherited by Student Robotics prior to the formation of the CIO. The legacy server is defined as the Linode server known as 'saffron'. This machine currently hosts a selection of services, the management of which fall under multiple roles in the CIO organisational structure. Due to the multiplicity of the legacy server, it is desired for it to be retired and replaced with a system that allows for running of services managed by separate roles to be fully independent of one another.

Since there is the intention to ultimately retire the legacy server, this role has an inherently finite lifetime. Once the server has been retired this role will cease to exist.

Note that this role does not allow for any further development of features specific to the legacy server itself; it is purely a maintenance role to keep the server operational. This does not preclude development and improvement of the services currently running on the legacy server by the relevant roles.
