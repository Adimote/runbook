# Legacy Server Maintainer (LSM) Role Definition

This page defines the Legacy Server Maintainer (LSM) role that reports to the Kit Software Coordinator. This role cannot create subordinate roles.

## Purpose
The role of the LSM is to maintain the operation of the legacy server inherited by Student Robotics prior to the formation of the CIO. The legacy server is defined as the Linode server known as 'saffron'. This machine currently hosts a selection of services, the management of which fall under multiple roles in the CIO organisational structure. Due to the multiplicity of the legacy server, it is desired for it to be retired and replaced with a system that allows for running of services managed by separate roles to be fully independent of one another.
