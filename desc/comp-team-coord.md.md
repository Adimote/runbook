# Competition Team Coordinator

This document is a description of the high-level responsibilities of the competition team coordinator role (and not how the role should be done!)

The competition team coordinator has the following responsibilities:

 1. Ensuring teams are well-informed about the event whilst they are
    at the event, including the site rules, how they should get to a
    match, and where their pits are.

 2. Kit collection from teams. The Competition Team Coordinator should
    interact with the Kit Logistics Coordinator regarding this.

 3. Reception, which includes:

    * Ensuring everyone who enters into the venue has a valid media
      consent arrangement. This includes checking tickets, and getting
      media consent forms signed. It also includes the procurement,
      distribution and checking of wristbands (or an equivalent venue
      re-entry system).

    * Collecting any items of kit from teams upon entry that they are
      required to hand in at that point (e.g. battery chargers).

    * Keeping a log of who has attended the competition, including
      their team affiliation.

 4. Managing team access to the arenas during tinker time.
