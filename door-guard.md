At the end of the competition, teams tend to evaporate without warning. We wish
to ensure that they return the loaned SR kit, unless they've arranged otherwise.
To this end, door guards are people who guard the exit doors at the venue:
near the reception end of the building there are exits to the car park.

Door guards shouldn't constrict access to the exits, but instead challenge
people exiting thus:
 * Has your team been signed out at reception?
 * (If carrying kit) Has your team arranged a loan extension for the kit?

Guard duty starts from the moment the final match stops (many teams don't wait
for awards before leaving).
