# Introductory Briefer

The introductory and H&S brief-er gives a ~10m talk at the beginning of the
competition regarding matters of importance, which at a high level are:

 * Health and Safety 
 * How the competition operates

In that order.

Health & Safety should cover at least:

 * Common sense (i.e., don't run everywhere)
 * Use of tools
 * Battery safety
 * Robot safety checking

The competition intro talk should:

 * Introduce tinker time
 * Explain (and illustrate) the procedure for operating the robot in a match,
   from gate to gate.
 * Lay down rules on who is allowed where
 * Describe tinker time and make it clear how one books tinker time.
