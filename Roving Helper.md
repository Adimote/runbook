# Roving Helper

A Roving Helper is a volunteer who wanders around the pit areas to assist teams with quick and simple problems. If an issue cannot be easily resolved then the team should be referred to [[Helpdesk]].

A Roving Helper may be requested, by [[Helpdesk]], to investigate a particular issue a team is having. This will most likely involve working through the problem with the team in their pit. In some cases it might involve observing and aiding a team over the period of a couple of matches to diagnose particularly obscure issues.
