# Helpdesk

Helpdesk is the teams' primary source of support. Volunteers are expected to advise teams in a similar fashion to mentoring - that is they should not tell teams what to do, but offer advice and guidance. The volunteers also help with kit related issues that may or may not be caused by a problem with the kit. It is the responsibility of the Helpdesk volunteers to assess teams' problems and, if necessary, swap out bits of kit hardware. In some situations teams may need to be put in contact with a person with more in-depth knowledge of the kit to help diagnose and fix issues.

## Equipment

 * Two copies of the rules - one attached to a desk by some means
 * A copy of this document
 * Helpdesk logbook

 * Issue Forms for both Helpdesk Volunteers and Roving Helpers
 * Kit Swap Forms
 * Spare kit in the 'spare kit box'
 * List of spare kit
 * Broken kit box
 * Laptop to view documentation and the IDE
 * Red insulating tape
 * Permanent marker
 * Large post-it notes
 * Radio
 * Emergency contact numbers for the Competition Team Support Coordinator (Rich Barlow) and the Competition Event Coordinator (Rob Spanton)

## Volunteer Requirements

At least one volunteer on Helpdesk must have prior experience of the use of the Student Robotics kit.

## Procedures

### Handling of all requests

Whenever a team comes to Helpdesk with an issue that cannot be solved instantly their TLA and a very brief (couple of words) summary of the problem must be written on a post-it note and stuck up on a board of current issues. This ensures that no problems get dropped while they are being investigated. When the issue is resolved the post-it note can be thrown away. If it appears that a particular post-it has remained on the board for an extended period of time and there has been no obvious activity to resolve the issue then a volunteer should be dispatched to the team to see if it's still a problem.

### Handling of requests for robot safety checks

The robots require safety checking before they are allowed to compete in the competition. Teams will not be given their hi-viz vest until their robot has passed the safety check procedure. Helpdesk volunteers should direct teams enquiring about safety checks to the Health & Safety Coordinator (Scarzy).

### Handling of general robot development requests

Many teams will come to Helpdesk requesting help with the development of their robot or, more likely, help using the Student Robotics kit and associated software. As mentioned earlier, Helpdesk volunteers are not expected to tell teams what to do, but rather offer advice. Helpdesk volunteers should strive to answer questions about the use of the kit and software.

Some queries may require a volunteer to visit the team in their pit to observe behaviour in situ. This must only be done by a Helpdesk volunteer if it will leave no fewer than two volunteers actively manning Helpdesk. If it is not possible for a Helpdesk volunteer to visit a team then a [[Roving Helper]] should be summoned, via radio if necessary.

In some rare situations it may be necessary to request the assistance of a person with more in-depth knowledge of the kit to help solve an issue. This should only be done if the issue is non-trivial. The following people are available for specific help and can be summoned over the radio:

Electronic Hardware
:  Rich Barlow
:  Rob Spanton

IDE
:  Peter Law

Python API
:  Peter Law
:  Rich Barlow
:  Rob Spanton
:  Jeremy Morse

### Handling suspected damaged kit requests

**NB: this procedure may change if the laptop on Helpdesk is configured to aid in hardware testing.**

If a team comes to Helpdesk with a suspicion of some of the Student Robotics kit being damaged then the following procedure should be followed:

 1. Request that the team take a freshly charged battery and see if the problem persists.
 1. Request that the team tries swapping the USB and power cables to the device in question, where applicable.
 1. If the kit contains multiple of the device in question (e.g. USB hub, motor board), request that the team tries swapping it with the other one in the kit.
 1. Request that the team tests the device in question with a very simple code project that only attempts to control that one device.
 1. If all previous steps indicate that the device is probably faulty then continue with the kit swap procedure.

### Swapping out kit

**NB: this procedure may change if I produce some printed kit swap forms.**

After determining that a piece of kit is most likely faulty it must be swapped with a working spare. Helpdesk has a supply of spare kit. This kit must be handed out by following the procedure detailed below. Since there is a limited quantity of spare kit, all attempts must be made to verify that the issue being observed is not caused by something else.

 1. Receive the piece of damaged kit from the team.
 1. If the piece of kit has a part code (pretty much anything that's not a cable), write it down in the log book along with the date and time, the team's TLA and a description of the fault (does not need to be more than a single sentence).
 1. Apply some red insulating tape to the item so that it can clearly be identified as broken.
 1. Place the broken piece of kit into the broken kit box.
 1. Retrieve a replacement piece of kit from the spare kit box.
 1. Write down the replacement part code (where applicable) in the log book so that it's clear which bit of kit it is replacing.
 1. Hand the replacement piece of kit to the team.
