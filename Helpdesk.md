# Helpdesk

Helpdesk is the teams' primary source of support. Volunteers are expected to advise teams in a similar fashion to mentoring - that is they should not tell teams what to do, but offer advice and guidance. The volunteers also help with kit related issues that may or may not be caused by a problem with the kit. It is the responsibility of the Helpdesk volunteers to assess teams' problems and, if necessary, swap out bits of kit hardware. In some situations teams may need to be put in contact with a person with more in-depth knowledge of the kit to help diagnose and fix issues.

## Equipment

 * Two copies of the rules - one attached to a desk by some means
 * Helpdesk logbook
 * Spare kit
 * List of spare kit
 * Laptop
 * Red insulating tape
 * Permanent marker

## Volunteer Requirements

At least one volunteer on Helpdesk must have prior experience of the use of the Student Robotics kit.

## Procedures

### Handling suspected damaged kit requests

**NB: this procedure may change if the laptop on helpdesk is configured to aid in hardware testing.**

If a team comes to helpdesk with a suspicion of some of the Student Robotics kit being damaged then the following procedure should be followed:

 1. Request that the team take a freshly charged battery and see if the problem persists.
 1. Request that the team tries swapping the USB and power cables to the device in question, where applicable.
 1. If the kit contains multiple of the device in question (e.g. USB hub, motor board), request that the team tries swapping it with the other one in the kit.
 1. Request that the team tests the device in question with a very simple code project that only attempts to control that one device.
 1. If all previous steps indicate that the device is probably faulty then continue with the kit swap procedure.

### Swapping out kit

**NB: this procedure may change if I produce some printed kit swap forms.**

After determining that a piece of kit is most likely faulty it must be swapped with a working spare. Helpdesk has a supply of spare kit. This kit must be handed out by following the procedure detailed below. Since there is a limited quantity of spare kit, all attempts must be made to verify that the issue being observed is not caused by something else.

 1. Receive the piece of damaged kit from the team.
 1. If the piece of kit has a part code (pretty much anything that's not a cable), write it down in the log book along with a description of the fault and the team's TLA.
 1. Apply some red insulating tape to the item so that it can clearly be identified as broken.
 1. Place the broken piece of kit into the broken kit box.
 1. Retrieve a replacement piece of kit from the spare kit box.
 1. Write down the replacement part code (where applicable) in the log book so that it's clear which bit of kit it is replacing.
 1. Hand the replacement piece of kit to the team.
