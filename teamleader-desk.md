Brand new this year!

The teamleader desk is a location for co-ordinating with team leaders at the
start of the competition. There are two aims:
 * Team entry/exit recording
 * Stripping restricted parts of robots

Teamleader desk staff will have sign-in / sign-out sheet(s) for team leaders to
record that their teams have arrived and when they leave. Reception will direct
team leaders to the desk; you should get the team-leader to sign the sheet.

You should then inform the team-leader that we remove two SR-issued items from
teams on entry:
 * Batteries
 * Battery chargers
and that they *must* arrange for their team to deliver those items to the desk.

Competitors with kit will turn up (from reception, or from team leaders). You
should ask them whether they have any of the two items above on them, and if
they do, retain them. If they're embedded in a robot, get the competitor to
extract them. Retained items should be put in a RUB or on the desk; someone
from helpdesk will move them upstairs (XXX co-ordination).
