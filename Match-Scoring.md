# Match Scoring Roles

Any roles related to scoring matches go here.

## Head Match Scorer

**Responsible for managing the scorers and score entry which they may bring in as their only subordinate roles.**

They should station themselves near the arena/staging area to ensure any questions with regards to scoring can be asked.

## Match Scorer

**Responsible for being in the arena, saving robots and scoring matches. They may not bring in any subordinate volunteers.**

In this role you will be assigned an arena and work with a partner. You will be allowed to enter the arena during matches if it is deemed necessary, however it is very important that you do not obstruct any robot or its vision and leave the arena as soon as possible. Each of you will be each given a score sheet on a clipboard which you must both individually fill in fully by the end of the match. Anything that happens after the match has ended must not be counted as a score and the arena must not be changed until both scorers have finished. Once a match has finished it is your responsibility to take your completed score sheet to the score entry desk which will be near the arenas and you must return promptly to the arena in case you need to be found for further scoring questions. Teams are not allowed to enter the arena to collect their robots until after scoring has finished.

As well as scoring, your responsibilities include making sure robots start in the right corner, switching off robots that do not automatically turn off after a match ends and switching off robots when a team requests that you do so. You must also make sure that any arena props (tokens, for example) are in the correct place at the start of each match as detailed below. You are not responsible, however, for making sure a match starts with the correct number of teams -- that is down to the shepherds.

### Arena Setup Checklist

1. Tokens in the arena aren't damaged. If they are, swap them out with the spares.
2. The tokens in the arena are intended for that arena -- this can be established by reading the grey text printed on each marker on the token. Tokens for arena A have "Arena A" within the text, and tokens for arena B have "Arena B" within the text.
3. There must be nine tokens in the arena, with all three nets appearing at least once.
4. The four tokens closest to their respective starting zone for each robot has the colour of that zone facing upwards. All other tokens start with their top facing upwards in any orientation.
6. Each token is placed on one of the token starting positions that are marked out on the arena floor.

Teams must not be allowed in the arena during a match and only one team member is allowed in the area between the crowd barrier and arena wall. If that team members indicates that they wish for you to turn off their robot (i.e. "throwing in the towel") you may do so but by doing so they forfeit the match which will be recorded in the score sheets as a disqualification. It is the responsibility of the team members to place their robot in the start zone before the match starts. If a robot moves off before the match starts (aside from minor servo-resetting arm movements) teams are allowed to switch off their robot, reset it and start again. However, if the mis-started robot touches any arena prop then they are immediately disqualified. Once the robot start button has been pressed and the match has started, teams are not allowed to interact with their robots until after scoring has taken place.

You must read [points 1.1 to 1.7 and 3.5 of the rules](https://www.studentrobotics.org/docs/rules/) before starting this role to make sure you understand the game, the scoring rules and how the arena is laid out.

If you have any questions you may first ask the head match scorer and secondly the judge.

## Match Score Entry

**Responsible for receiving scores from the match scorers and entering them into the competition software. They may not bring in any subordinate volunteers.**

In the role of score entry you will be stationed at a desk near to the arena/staging area. When a score sheet is given to you by the match scorers, you will enter the scores into a computer and then file the score sheet in a folder.

You will be working closely with the head match scorer and also the competition software coordinator who will be stationed near to you (most likely on the same desk) and available if you have any questions.
