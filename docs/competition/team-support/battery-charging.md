# Battery Charging

We (Student Robotics) manage the charging of all batteries at the competition. Battery Charging volunteers are responsible for ensuring that there is a continuous supply of charged batteries available for use by teams.

## Setup

### Equipment
Most batteries and chargers will arrive with teams, but any batteries, bags, and chargers in inventory should be prepared during setup.
There are two locations involved in battery charging. The equipment required at each is as listed below:

- Helpdesk
    - 1 x Discharged Battery Box (18L RUB), clearly labelled
    - 1 x Charged Battery Box (18L RUB), clearly labelled
    - 1 x LiPo Bag for damaged batteries, clearly labelled, red taped
    - At least one roll of red insulating tape
- Battery Charging Station
    - 1 x Discharged Battery Box (18L RUB), clearly labelled
    - 1 x Charged Battery Box (18L RUB), clearly labelled
    - 1 x Damaged battery box (18L RUB), clearly labelled, red taped
    - At least one roll of red insulating tape
    - Example good batteries (one brand new, one squidgy)

### Safe Use of Battery Charging Equipment - Battery Charging Station 

- There should be `0.5A` of mains electricity available per charger.
- It should be ensured that any power distribution / 4 ways is setup properly and able to handle the current draw.
- Additionally, there should be no trailing wires across the floor to prevent charging batteries falling on the floor.

## Volunteer Requirements

Every volunteer performing the Battery Charging role must have read this document fully. Any doubts must be raised ASAP.

## Safety

The biggest risk of damage or injury is from the banana plugs coming unplugged from the charger. These are the red and black plugs that go into the side of the charger. All of the chargers should have the cables cable-tied to the charger to make it difficult to remove these plugs. Under no circumstances should these red and black plugs be unplugged from the chargers.

The batteries themselves have many built in safety features and, unless severely abused, are completely safe. All batteries undergoing charging must be placed inside a fireproof charging bag. In the extremely unlikely event of a fire due to a battery DO NOT attempt to tackle the fire - the batteries contain a flammable metal (Lithium) which cannot be safely tackled with most fire extinguishers.

If at any point you have any doubts about safety, immediately summon the Health & Safety officer.

## Procedures

### Swapping a team's battery - Helpdesk

- Teams will bring their discharged battery to the Helpdesk
- Discharged batteries should be placed in the discharged battery box
- If the battery is damaged, red tape should be placed on it and it should be placed in the damaged LiPo bag instead of the discharged battery box. 
- A charged battery should be retrieved from the charged battery box and handed to the team.
    - Do not allow teams to take batteries from the box themselves.
    - If multiple batteries are returned, only give out one charged battery to each team.
    - In the event that no charged batteries are in the box, contact the battery charging station over the radio to request more.

### Swapping batteries - Shuffling

The volunteer that is running the battery charging station will periodically have to go and get discharge batteries from the helpdesk, simultaneously dropping off charged batteries. The helpdesk may also contact the volunteer to do it sooner.

- Charged LiPos should be taken to the helpdesk.
- Discharged and damaged LiPos should be taken to the battery charging station.
- Any batteries that were marked as damaged by the helpdesk, should be inspected and placed in the damaged battery box if they are damaged.

### Charging a discharged battery - Battery Charging Station

All of the battery chargers will be set-up and ready to use. Before a battery is connected the screen must display `LiPo BALANCE 2.2A 11.1V(3S)`. If it displays anything else then please do not use it and ask Helpdesk to summon help.

Batteries are charged as follows:

1. Check that the battery is not physically damaged. There should be no splits or tears in the body of the battery, no nicks in the wire insulation, no exposed wire and the battery should not be so swollen that it is no longer squidgy. There will be a couple of example batteries at the Battery Charging station to compare to.
    * if the battery is damaged, tape over the yellow XT60 connector with red tape and place it in the damaged battery box.
1. If the battery is not damaged, plug the yellow XT60 connector into the charger cable and the white balance connector into the 4-pin socket on the side of the charger.
1. Place the battery in the charging bag next to the charger.
1. Hold down the Start/Enter button for about 3 seconds until the screen displays `R:3SER S:3SER CONFIRM(ENTER)`. If both numbers are not 3 then disconnect the battery and summon the Health and Safety officer.
1. If the display is as expected, press Start/Enter to commence charging.
After about 1 hour the battery should complete charging - the screen will display a charge complete message. Simply disconnect the battery from the charger and place it in the charged battery box.

If at any point throughout the charging cycle the charger indicates an issue (e.g. a timeout, capacity or cable error), disconnect the battery from the charger, apply a piece of red tape to the yellow XT60 connector on the battery and place it in the damaged battery box. Inevitably there will be a small number of faulty chargers. If you suspect that a particular charger is faulty (lots of batteries fail to charge on it), disconnect it from its power supply, apply red tape to its yellow XT60 connector and place it in the damaged battery box.
