# Photo studio manager

The role of the photo studio manager is to take nice photos of teams with their robots.

You should have:
- A camera on a tripod.
- A notebook to annotate each photograph.

By far the most important part of this role is to make sure the photos are in focus and correctly framed.

To do this role please make sure you take note of which photos go to which team! Please write down the ID of the photos for each team (both the ID for the first and last).

# Photo studio helper

The helper's job is to fetch teams to be photographed by the Photo studio manager. It's almost guaranteed that not all teams will want to be photographed immediately, so try to do it in order, but all teams must eventually be photographed!

Make sure the teams bring their robots, and try to maintain a queue of max 2 teams to be photographed. Any more will be a waste of teams' time.

You should have:
- A clipboard with a checklist of teams.
- A map of the venue.
