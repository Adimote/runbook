# Refreshments

It's important that volunteers stay hydrated, which can be difficult for those in roles which don't allow them to move. (Don't give refreshments to competitors).

*In SR2019, the refreshments are in the Volunteer Rest room, which is past the toilets and to the left.*

It is the responsibility of the Refreshments role to offer and provide refreshments to all volunteers, especially those who can't leave their roles.

To do this, you should grab a tray, fill it with a mix of drinks and food, and go to all volunteer positions, offering refreshments.
Please also fill some cups with water from a nearby water fountain, and brew coffee/tea if available.

Please don't forget about those at tech decks, those at reception/helpdesk, and those who are commentating/marshalling.

## Running low on refreshments

If we're running low on refreshments, it's your responsiblity to either go or find someone to go get more from the nearby shops.

The nearest food shopfor SR2019 is the 'Coop Food' on Burgess road, see: https://goo.gl/maps/VETqx4apQet

We recommend the items you get are:
- Coffee (if we have cups)
- Plastic tumblers
- Soft drinks
- Fruit
- Biscuits

Keep hold of your receipts, and send them in when we ask for Travel reimbursements, repayments will be made at that time.
