# Refreshments

It's important that volunteers stay hydrated, which can be difficult for those in roles which don't allow them to move.

It is the responsibility of the Refreshments role to offer and provide refreshments to all volunteers, especially those who can't leave their roles.

We don't have enough refreshments for competitors, so please don't give them out

In SR2019, the refreshments are in the Volunteer Rest room (past the toilets). Please grab a tray, fill it with a mix of drinks and food, and go around to all volunteer positions, offering refreshments.
