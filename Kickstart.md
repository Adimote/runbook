**Kickstart**


* Once the Kickstart Coordinator (in conjunction with the Local Kickstart Coordinators) has organised the locations of the Kickstart events this information should be relayed by the LTCs to their teams asking them to reply to the LTC about whether they will be attending a Kickstart event and if so which one.
* The LTC should pass on this information to the Kickstart Coordinator so that plans can be made.
