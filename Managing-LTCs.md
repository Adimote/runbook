* Need to monitor LTCs' progress regarding:
    * Mentor-team matching
    * Checking their teams’ progress (to minimise drop-outs)
    * Check teams’ use of user accounts to monitor activity
    * Tech Day organisation

* Advice to LTCs re. obtaining info/support:

    * From a team's point of view, we should be trying to enforce the following flow for getting assistance:

      1.Ask mentor

      2.Look/ask on forum (interchangeable with 1)

      3.If the forum is not working (no reply or unsatisfied with the outcome) contact their LTC

    * Therefore if an LTC receives an email requesting help with some kit, they should politely guide the team to the forum or their mentor first - they may even find that their question has already been asked and answered. 
    * If the team then indicates that they do not wish to make their problem public then the LTC can forward on their query to the relevant person. 
    * For kit related queries this is kit-support@studentrobotics.org.   
    * For anything else they should do the default of emailing teams@studentrobotics.org.
