# Student Robotics Arena Manager

This is the Arena Manager's documentation. The Arena Manager is responsible for constructing and de-constructing the arenas at the competition.

## Arena components

The arenas consist of the following major components:

 * Carpet
 * Walls
 * Props (game specific)
 * Markers (both on walls and props)
 * Corner displays

## Game Agnostic Set-up Plan

Each year, no matter what the game, the arenas require construction. Currently SR has two arenas at the competition. Each arena is an 8x8m carpeted area surrounded by 300mm high MDF walls. For further details about the design see the [rules](https://www.studentrobotics.org/rules). The following is a rough plan for arena construction.
