# Student Robotics Competition Team Support Documentation

This is the Competition Team Support Coordinator's documentation. The Competition Team Support Coordinator is responsible for ensuring that teams are supported, with technical problems, throughout the competition. There are no subordinate roles.

## Helpdesk
The main source of support for teams is Helpdesk. Helpdesk is always manned by at least two volunteers and ideally three volunteers. There should always be at least one volunteer who has experience with the SR kit on Helpdesk at any point in time.

## Battery Charging
Teams have their batteries and chargers taken off of them when they arrive at the competition. Student Robotics takes responsibility for charging of batteries throughout the competition. The battery charging station is located next to Helpdesk. The battery charging station is always manned by at least one volunteer and ideally two volunteers.
