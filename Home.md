# Student Robotics Arena Manager

This is the Arena Manager's documentation. The Arena Manager is responsible for constructing and de-constructing the arenas at the competition.

## Tasks

The following tasks are generally applicable from one year to the next. As the responsibilities of the role change these tasks should be updated to suit.

Pre-competition (in no particular order):

 * Specify and order tape (coloured gaffer for corner related things, double-sided for carpet laying and marker application [arena and tokens], black for carpet edge and other uses).
 * Specify and source/hire crowd barrier requirements for use around arenas and staging area.
 * Specify and order carpet.
 * Specify and hire network equipment.
 * Specify and hire power equipment.

 * Specify and hire screens and screen mounts.
 * Work with Competition Software Coordinator to obtain necessary display hardware.
 * Specify and source/hire staging area desks.
 * Specify and source/order arena walls (we already own some, so only required if they change).

Setup (roughly in time order):

 * Install carpet.
 * Install arena walls.
 * Install markings on arena floor in accordance with the game rules, to denote the starting positions of props and to provide human readable markings (corner numbers).
 * Install crowd barriers around arenas and staging area.

 * Install the display hardware onto the back of the screens.
