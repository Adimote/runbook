# Student Robotics Arena Manager

This is the Arena Manager's documentation. The Arena Manager is responsible for constructing and de-constructing the arenas at the competition.

## Arena components

The arenas consist of the following major components:

 * Carpet
 * Walls
 * Props (game specific)
 * Markers (both on walls and props)
 * Corner displays

## Game Agnostic Set-up Plan

Each year, no matter what the game, the arenas require construction. Currently SR has two arenas at the competition. Each arena is an 8x8m carpeted area surrounded by 300mm high MDF walls. For further details about the design see the [rules](https://www.studentrobotics.org/rules). The following is a rough plan for arena construction.


### Materials

 * Budget cord carpet - 2x 18x4m rolls and 1x 9x4m roll
 * NEC approved low-tac double sided-tape 5x 38mm x 5m rolls
 * Insulating tape (for marking out)
 * Arena walls
 * XXmmxXXmm wood screws [not sure what size, will take 20mm and 30mm then update this doc afterwards]

### Tools

 * Scissors
 * Stanley knife
 * Tape measure (>10m highly recommended)
 * PZ2 screwdriver
 * 2x battery drills w. PZ2 screwdriver bits
