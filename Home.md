# Student Robotics Arena Manager

This is the Arena Manager's documentation. The Arena Manager is responsible for constructing and de-constructing the arenas at the competition.

## Arena components

The arenas consist of the following major components:

 * Carpet
 * Walls
 * Props (game specific)
 * Markers (both on walls and props)
 * Corner displays

## Game Agnostic Set-up Plan

Each year, no matter what the game, the arenas require construction. Currently SR has two arenas at the competition. Each arena is an 8x8m carpeted area surrounded by 300mm high MDF walls. For further details about the design see the [rules](https://www.studentrobotics.org/rules). The following is a rough plan for arena construction.

**Four people are required for arena construction**

### Materials

 * Budget cord carpet - 2x 18x4m rolls and 1x 9x4m roll
 * NEC approved low-tac double sided-tape - 5x 38mm x 50m rolls
 * Insulating tape (for marking out - so the colour is unimportant)
 * Arena walls
 * XXmmxXXmm wood screws [not sure what size, will take 20mm and 30mm then update this doc afterwards]
 * 50x 5-litre HDPE jerrycans
 * A water supply
 * Double-sided finger-lift tape - 1x 12mm x 50m roll
 * White gaffer tape - 1x 50mm x 50m roll
 * Arena wall libkoki markers
 * Fluorescent gaffer tape - 4x 48mm x 25m rolls one each of yellow, green, orange and pink
 * Metal crowd-control barriers

### Tools

 * Scissors
 * Stanley knife
 * Tape measure (>10m highly recommended)
 * PZ2 screwdriver
 * 2x battery drills w. PZ2 screwdriver bits

## Procedure

 1. Mark out where the carpet will be laid on the venue floor with insulation tape. **[15 mins]**
 1. Lay the carpet by applying strips of NEC double sided tape to the floor and roll the carpet out onto it in sections. **[1 hour]**
 1. The following steps can be carried out in parallel. Two people work on each step.
    1. Mark out where the arena walls will be laid on the carpet with insulating tape. **[15 mins]**
    1. Fill the jerrycans with water. **[15 mins]**
 1. Place the arena walls onto the carpet. The wall sections are number and must be placed in the correct order so that the screw holes line up. **[30 mins]**
 1. Screw the wall sections together. **[30 mins]**
 1. Place the jerrycans on the wall feet. **[15 mins]**
 1. Mark out where the arena wall markers are to be stuck with insulating tape on the carpet next to the wall face. **[15 mins]**
 1. Apply the markers to the walls using a cross of double-sided tape and surround the edges with white gaffer tape. Take care to ensure the ordering and arena assignment (A/B) is correct. **[30 mins]**
 1. Mark out the corners with the fluorescent gaffer tape and write the corner number on the carpet with the tape. **[15 mins]**
 1. Apply the A/B markers to the outside of the arena walls. **[15 mins]**
 1. Place the crowd-control barrier around the arenas. **[15 mins]**

Total construction time: **4 hours 15 mins.**

## SR2016 Game (Sunny Side Up) Specific Set-up Plan

The SR2016 game requires tokens to be constructed. These tokens consist of cardboard box cubes with 250mm side-length covered with libkoki markers. To assist human spectators, coloured gaffer tape is applied to the faces of the cube.

### Materials

 * Cardboard boxes - 36x 9"x9"x9" double-wall boxes (external dimensions approx. 245mm x 254mm x 254mm)
 * Token libkoki markers
 *
