# Student Robotics Competition Team Support Documentation

This is the Competition Team Support Coordinator's documentation. The Competition Team Support Coordinator is responsible for ensuring that teams are supported, with technical problems, throughout the competition. The Competition Team Support team consists of four roles:

 * [[Helpdesk]] Volunteers
 * [[Battery Shufflers]]
 * [[Battery Charging]] Volunteers
 * [[Roving Helpers]]

These roles will be filled by various people throughout the competition. All volunteers filling these roles report to the Competition Team Support Coordinator and may not create subordinate roles.

## Helpdesk
The main source of support for teams is Helpdesk. Helpdesk is always manned by at least two volunteers and ideally three volunteers. There should always be at least one volunteer who has experience with the SR kit on Helpdesk at any point in time. Further details can be found in the [[Helpdesk]] docs.

## Battery Charging
Teams have their batteries and chargers taken off of them when they arrive at the competition. Student Robotics takes responsibility for charging of batteries throughout the competition. The battery charging station is located next to [[Helpdesk]]. The battery charging station is always manned by at least one volunteer and ideally two volunteers. Further details can be found in the [[Battery Charging]] docs.

## Roving Helpers
Teams will always have quick questions about the kit, the game and the competition in general. Most of these questions can be handled by volunteers on the spot. To help deal with these questions quickly and efficiently there should be volunteers, known as Roving Helpers, wandering around the pits. There should be as many Roving Helpers as possible throughout the competition, but there is no minimum number. Further details can be found in the [[Roving Helper]] docs.
